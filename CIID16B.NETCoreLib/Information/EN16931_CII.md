EN is more important than TS.

EN16931 is an EN with ID 16931.

Following EN16931 means you have to do the validation based on the namespace of the document.

UBL Invoices and CII Invoices are part of the Billing Business Process.
More info can be found at https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis

CII = Cross Industry Invoice

## CIUS and Extensions

EN 16931 is the base specification, but there are a lot of specifications on top of it.
These are extra rules, restrictions, customizations.

CEN/TR 16931-5:2017 contains the specifications and definitions about CIUS.


We call them CIUSes
CIUS is Core Invoice User Specification.
CEN is European Committee for Standardization.

There will be a list of registrated CIUSes but it is not yet completed.

There is also unofficial info about CIUSes in CEF
https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EINVCOMMUNITY/Registry+of+CIUS+%28Core+Invoice+Usage+Specifications%29+and+Extensions

The official list is here http://www.helger.com/registry434/ but it also uses the previous unofficial one as reference.


Besides the CIUSes there are also extensions for some countries.

For the validation of CIUSes there should be extra schematrons.

## XSD

CII has multiple versions D20A, D19B, D16B,...
The versions always start with D.
The 2 digits after D are the year, so D09 is the version of 2009.
The fourth character is A or B:
- A means from the first 6 months of the year.
- B means from the last 6 months of the year.

There is a namespace for ecery document.
But the namespace for Invoice and CreditNote are the same in CII.

Since 2016 there are 2 branches in the XML-schemas:
- old branch,  the same as before containing around 16 messages (documents)
- the Supply Chain Reference Data Model (SCRDM).
	For now SCRDM contains only the Invoice Message.

Example:
- SCRDM Invoice --> urn:un:unece:uncefact:data:standard:CrossIndustryInvoice:100
- old branch Invoice --> urn:un:Unece:uncefact:data:standard:CrossIndustryInvoice:13

The CII XSDs are published in 3 variants:
- Uncoupled: that means not coupled with Code lists.
- SCRDM coupled: means the messages(documents) are coupled with the codelists of the SCRDM-branch.
- Coupled : means the messages are coupled with the codelists of the old branch.


## UBL Versus CII
There is no one to one mapping between UBL and CII.
- Some parts are related or simular.
- Some parts can only be found in UBL but not in CII.
- Some parts can only be found in CII but not in UBL.

UBL is not tightly bound to code lists.
UBL has around 62 business documents.
CII has around 16 business documents.

Remark:
All UBLs have an etension point as first element but an UBL extension is not a CEN/TC434 extension.
