## Assignment: Pass the CEF Conformance Test for CII Invoice

### Conformance Test
There are three types of tests:
- Web Form upload.
- WebService using SOAP.
- eDelivery.

Remarks: For INEA grants we only do eDelivery.

#### Web Form
Everybody can do the test.
It is anonymous, no login needed.

#### Web Service
You need an account to login.
You need to inform theService Desk to get the right configuration.
It is based on SOAp (SOAPUI)

#### eDelivery Test
You need an account to log in.

There are two kinds of tests:
- eDelivery AS2 validation (only sending)
- eDelivery AS4 validation (sending and receiving)

To do the tests you have to login at the Testbed.
To create an account for the Testbed, you need an EU-login account first.

if it is an INEA action then you need the INEA Action Number!
